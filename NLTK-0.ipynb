    "This notebook is the first in a series designed to introduce you to Natural Language Processing via the Natural Language Toolkit. It's been forked from a version developed by [Lisa Rhody](http://lrhody.com) for her [Methods of Text Analysis](https://femethods2020.commons.gc.cuny.edu) course at the CUNY Graduate Center. (This is a course I really wish I could take. If you get interested in the work we're doing with text analysis, I encourage you to dig into her syllabus for more.)\n",

    "These notebooks draw on the first chapters of the online textbook [*Natural Language Processing with Python*](https://www.nltk.org/book/), working to make their lessons hands-on without requiring you to shift your attention between the text and a Python development environment. If you want to go further with NLTK, you may want to experiment with Spyder, a Python IDE (or integrated development environment) available in Anaconda Navigator.\n",

    "# Preface\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a book about Natural Language Processing. By \"natural language\" we mean a language that is used for everyday communication by humans; languages like English, Hindi or Portuguese. In contrast to artificial languages such as programming languages and mathematical notations, natural languages have evolved as they pass from generation to generation, and are hard to pin down with explicit rules. We will take Natural Language Processing — or NLP for short — in a wide sense to cover any kind of computer manipulation of natural language. At one extreme, it could be as simple as counting word frequencies to compare different writing styles. At the other extreme, NLP involves \"understanding\" complete human utterances, at least to the extent of being able to give useful responses to them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Technologies based on NLP are becoming increasingly widespread. For example, phones and handheld computers support predictive text and handwriting recognition; web search engines give access to information locked up in unstructured text; machine translation allows us to retrieve texts written in Chinese and read them in Spanish; text analysis enables us to detect sentiment in tweets and blogs. By providing more natural human-machine interfaces, and more sophisticated access to stored information, language processing has come to play a central role in the multilingual information society.\n",
    "\n",
    "This book provides a highly accessible introduction to the field of NLP. It can be used for individual study or as the textbook for a course on natural language processing or computational linguistics, or as a supplement to courses in artificial intelligence, text mining, or corpus linguistics. The book is intensely practical, containing hundreds of fully-worked examples and graded exercises.\n",
    "\n",
    "The book is based on the Python programming language together with an open source library called the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK). NLTK includes extensive software, data, and documentation, all freely downloadable from http://nltk.org/. Distributions are provided for Windows, Macintosh and Unix platforms. We strongly encourage you to download Python and NLTK, and try out the examples and exercises along the way.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Audience\n",
    "\n",
    "NLP is important for scientific, economic, social, and cultural reasons. NLP is experiencing rapid growth as its theories and methods are deployed in a variety of new language technologies. For this reason it is important for a wide range of people to have a working knowledge of NLP. Within industry, this includes people in human-computer interaction, business information analysis, and web software development. Within academia, it includes people in areas from humanities computing and corpus linguistics through to computer science and artificial intelligence. (To many people in academia, NLP is known by the name of \"Computational Linguistics.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "This book is intended for a diverse range of people who want to learn how to write programs that analyze written language, regardless of previous programming experience:\n",
    "\n",
    "**New to programming?:**<br>\n",
    "The early chapters of the book are suitable for readers with no prior knowledge of programming, so long as you aren't afraid to tackle new concepts and develop new computing skills. The book is full of examples that you can copy and try for yourself, together with hundreds of graded exercises. If you need a more general introduction to Python, see the list of Python resources at http://docs.python.org/.<br>\n",
    "**New to Python?:**<br>\n",
    "Experienced programmers can quickly learn enough Python using this book to get immersed in natural language processing. All relevant Python features are carefully explained and exemplified, and you will quickly come to appreciate Python's suitability for this application area. The language index will help you locate relevant discussions in the book.<br>\n",
    "**Already dreaming in Python?:**<br>\n",
    "Skim the Python examples and dig into the interesting language analysis material that starts in 1.. You'll soon be applying your skills to this fascinating domain.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Emphasis\n",
    "\n",
    "This book is a practical introduction to NLP. You will learn by example, write real programs, and grasp the value of being able to test an idea through implementation. If you haven't learnt already, this book will teach you programming. Unlike other programming books, we provide extensive illustrations and exercises from NLP. The approach we have taken is also principled, in that we cover the theoretical underpinnings and don't shy away from careful linguistic and computational analysis. We have tried to be pragmatic in striking a balance between theory and application, identifying the connections and the tensions. Finally, we recognize that you won't get through this unless it is also pleasurable, so we have tried to include many applications and examples that are interesting and entertaining, sometimes whimsical.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that this book is not a reference work. Its coverage of Python and NLP is selective, and presented in a tutorial style. For reference material, please consult the substantial quantity of searchable resources available at http://python.org/ and http://nltk.org/.\n",
    "\n",
    "This book is not an advanced computer science text. The content ranges from introductory to intermediate, and is directed at readers who want to learn how to analyze text using Python and the Natural Language Toolkit. To learn about advanced algorithms implemented in NLTK, you can examine the Python code linked from http://nltk.org/, and consult the other materials cited in this book.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a simple yet powerful programming language with excellent functionality for processing linguistic data. Python can be downloaded for free from http://python.org/. Installers are available for all platforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a five-line Python program that processes file.txt and prints all the words ending in ing:\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "for line in open(\"file.txt\"):\n",
    "     for word in line.split():\n",
    "         if word.endswith('ing'):\n",
    "             print(word)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This program illustrates some of the main features of Python. First, whitespace is used to nest lines of code, thus the line starting with if falls inside the scope of the previous line starting with for; this ensures that the ing test is performed for each word. Second, Python is object-oriented; each variable is an entity that has certain defined attributes and methods. For example, the value of the variable line is more than a sequence of characters. It is a string object that has a \"method\" (or operation) called split() that we can use to break a line into its words. To apply a method to an object, we write the object name, followed by a period, followed by the method name, i.e. line.split(). Third, methods have arguments expressed inside parentheses. For instance, in the example, word.endswith('ing') had the argument 'ing' to indicate that we wanted words ending with ing and not something else. Finally — and most importantly — Python is highly readable, so much so that it is fairly easy to guess what the program does even if you have never written a program before.\n",
    "\n",
    "We chose Python because it has a shallow learning curve, its syntax and semantics are transparent, and it has good string-handling functionality. As an interpreted language, Python facilitates interactive exploration. As an object-oriented language, Python permits data and methods to be encapsulated and re-used easily. As a dynamic language, Python permits attributes to be added to objects on the fly, and permits variables to be typed dynamically, facilitating rapid development. Python comes with an extensive standard library, including components for graphical programming, numerical processing, and web connectivity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is heavily used in industry, scientific research, and education around the world. Python is often praised for the way it facilitates productivity, quality, and maintainability of software. A collection of Python success stories is posted at http://python.org/about/success/.\n",
    "\n",
    "NLTK defines an infrastructure that can be used to build NLP programs in Python. It provides basic classes for representing data relevant to natural language processing; standard interfaces for performing tasks such as part-of-speech tagging, syntactic parsing, and text classification; and standard implementations for each task which can be combined to solve complex problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "NLTK comes with extensive documentation. In addition to this book, the website at http://nltk.org/ provides API documentation that covers every module, class and function in the toolkit, specifying parameters and giving examples of usage."
